Twilight-bound wanderer, calm and knowing.

The Magus — mid-thirties, lean build, short brown beard, long brown hair, and brown eyes that hold steady warmth. Moves lightly, always balanced, dressed for ease — soft layers meant for travel and quick motion. Calm, reflective, faintly ironic.

Carries a small hextech cube that shifts like a puzzle of light and gears. Keeps a simple pipe and often a cup of tea nearby. His clothes smell faintly of smoke and spice, worn but well cared for. A quiet, grounded presence — more dusk than dawn.

Some say the cube hums when he’s angry. Others claim it remembers what it solves. Folk swear he once brewed tea that showed the future — or burned it, depending on who tells it. A child once said his pipe smoke formed constellations that spoke back. Travelers whisper he can vanish between blinks, that his shadow walks a heartbeat behind him. None agree whether he’s a man of great power or just someone who knows how to listen when the world speaks.
